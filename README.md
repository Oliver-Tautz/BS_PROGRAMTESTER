# BS PROGRAMTESTER

Lua script written as tutor at Universit√§t Bielefeld to speed up marking of submitted solutions. It calls a submission multiple times with 
values supplied in a csv files and prints its output in addition to the expected output. For usage hints just call the script with --h

# Requirements


If you want to use it you will need lua. I used lua 5.4.3 but dont use any special features I think, so newer/older versions should work.
The script uses the argparse module. Get it here: https://github.com/mpeterv/argparse . 

You can install lua in your home if you need to, see e.g. here: https://www.programmersought.com/article/6950130037/

I only wrote this for linux! I have no idea if it works on windows or mac ...
